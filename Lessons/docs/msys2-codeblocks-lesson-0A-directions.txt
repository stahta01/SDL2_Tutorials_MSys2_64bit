What I did to try to change the steps from here so they work under MSys2 using Code::Blocks IDE.

# Open "MinGW Shell"
# cd to the correct mingw folder
cd /mingw32
# or
cd /mingw64
# Record "pwd -W" path will need it to setup the Code::Blocks Compiler toolchain settings.
pwd -W

# Create top development folder; you should be able to use a different top development folder but my directions use "~/devel"
mkdir -p ~/devel
cd ~/devel

# Make the directory that will hold source code.
mkdir -p Lessons/Lesson0A/src
# Make the directory that will hold Code::Blocks project files.
mkdir -p Lessons/build


# Paste the Test Program into Code::Blocks Editor
