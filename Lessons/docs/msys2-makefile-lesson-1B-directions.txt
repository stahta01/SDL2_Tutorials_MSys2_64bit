What I did to try to follow the steps from here 
    http://www.willusher.io/sdl2%20tutorials/2014/08/01/postscript-1-easy-cleanup/

# From inside MinGW Shell

cd ~/devel/Lessons
scite include/cleanup.h
# Copy code from URL

mkdir -p ~/devel/Lessons/Lesson1B/src 
cd ~/devel/Lessons

cp Lesson1A/src/main.cpp  Lesson1B/src/main.cpp


scite Lesson1B/src/main.cpp
# Do the second set of code changes from the URL above.
# The one with this line "cleanup(tex, ren, win);"
# Remember to leave the this line in "SDL_Quit();"
# Add an include at the top of "#include "cleanup.h""


# Copy last makefile to the new makefile name.
cp build/Lesson1A.mak  build/Lesson1B.mak

cd ~/devel/Lessons/build
scite Lesson1B.mak
# Change "Lesson1A" to "Lesson1B"

make -f Lesson1B.mak clean
make -f Lesson1B.mak

# Run the program.
../bin/SDL_Lesson1B.exe &
