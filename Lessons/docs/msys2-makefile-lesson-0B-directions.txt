What I did to try to follow the steps from here 
    http://www.willusher.io/sdl2%20tutorials/2014/06/16/postscript-0-properly-finding-resource-paths/


mkdir -p ~/devel/Lessons/include
cd ~/devel/Lessons/include

scite res_path.h
# Copy the getResourcePath code from the URL above and save it.
# Change line "#include <SDL.h>" to "#include <SDL2/SDL.h>"

mkdir -p ~/devel/Lessons/Lesson0B/src
cd ~/devel/Lessons/Lesson0B/src

scite main.cpp
# Copy the "Using the Resource Path Lookup" code into text editor.


mkdir -p ~/devel/Lessons/build
cd ~/devel/Lessons
cp Lesson0A/src/Makefile build/Lesson0B.mak

cd ~/devel/Lessons/build
scite Lesson0B.mak
# Change "main.cpp" to "../Lesson0B/src/main.cpp"
# Change line "SDL_INCLUDE = " by adding "-I../include " without the quote after the "= ".
# Change line "EXE = SDL_Lesson0.exe" to "EXE = ../bin/SDL_Lesson0.exe" 

mkdir -p ~/devel/Lessons/bin
make -f Lesson0B.mak

# Run the program.
../bin/SDL_Lesson0.exe

# I got this output "Resource path is: C:\Apps64\MSys2_SDL2\home\stahta01\devel\Lessons\res\"
