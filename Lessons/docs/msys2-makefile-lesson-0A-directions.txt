What I did to try to change the steps from here so they work under MSys2
    http://www.willusher.io/sdl2%20tutorials/2013/08/15/lesson-0-mingw/

# Open "MinGW Shell"
# The output when ran from "MinGW64 Shell"
sdl2-config --cflags # -I/mingw64/include/SDL2 -Dmain=SDL_main
sdl2-config --libs   # -L/mingw64/lib -lmingw32 -lSDL2main -lSDL2 -mwindows
cd /mingw64/include/SDL2
pwd -W # Record the Windows path for usage in makefile
# Windows path := C:/Apps64/MSys2_SDL2/mingw64/include/SDL2

mkdir -p ~/devel/Lessons/Lesson0A/src
cd ~/devel/Lessons/Lesson0A/src
scite Makefile
# Copy the Makefile from lesson-0-mingw into Scite and save it.
# Change the "del" command in the clean step to "rm" in both places.

# Change the line with "SDL_LIB =" to have the output from sdl2-config --libs
# Change the line with "SDL_INCLUDE =" to have the output from sdl2-config --cflags
# But change the path for SDL2 to use the result of the "pwd -W" command above
# Change the line with "LDFLAGS =" to "LDFLAGS = $(SDL_LIB)"
# Save the Makefile

scite main.cpp 
# Paste the Test Program into Editor

# make the program to verify the program compiles and links without error.
make

# How to run the program; note the program does nothing that shows at this time. 
./SDL_Lesson0.exe
