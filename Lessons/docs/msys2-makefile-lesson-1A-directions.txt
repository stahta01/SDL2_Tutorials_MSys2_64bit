What I did to try to follow the steps from here 
    http://www.willusher.io/sdl2%20tutorials/2013/08/17/lesson-1-hello-world/

# From inside MinGW Shell

mkdir -p ~/devel/Lessons/Lesson1A/src 
cd ~/devel/Lessons

cp Lesson0B/src/main.cpp  Lesson1A/src/main.cpp


scite Lesson1A/src/main.cpp
# Remove all the code inside the main function
# Do the code changes from the URL above.
# Add "return 0;" to end of main function.


# Copy last makefile to the new makefile name.
cp build/Lesson0B.mak  build/Lesson1A.mak

cd ~/devel/Lessons/build
scite Lesson1A.mak
# Change "Lesson0" and "Lesson0B" to "Lesson1A"
# The option "-mconsole" is likely needed.
# Change line "LDFLAGS = $(SDL_LIB)" to "LDFLAGS = -mconsole $(SDL_LIB)"

make -f Lesson1A.mak clean
make -f Lesson1A.mak

# Run the program. I guessed on needing an "&" at the end.
../bin/SDL_Lesson1A.exe &

# I got this output "SDL_LoadBMP Error: Couldn't open C:\Apps64\MSys2_SDL2\home\stahta01\devel\Lessons\res\Lesson1\hello.bmp"

# Copy the res folder and its files to under Lessons folder.
# Run the program a second time it should work this time.
../bin/SDL_Lesson1A.exe &
